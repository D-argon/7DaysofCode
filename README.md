## About

7 logic challenges separated in 7 days from Alura, mine was mainly focused on JavaScript

---


## Day 1
#### Solve the common boolean issue where a String return true for an Int, e.g ` ' ' == 0 `.

Notes: 
* I thought it quite simple, as I already knew about the practice of `===`.

</details>


## Day 3
#### Dialog for choosing developer areas

Notes: 
* Now this one was a headache, not because it was hard, but because I made it hard as I thought it too simples. 
I ended up trying to mix jQuery, that I don't even know. but I got it in the end, without jQuery.

## Day 5
#### Grocery list input

Notes: 
* I again deviated from the essential and made way more complex, but no big issues.

## Day 6
#### Grocery list removal

Notes: 
* So the idea was to, by prompts remove a item, which I didn't see a necessity 
as it is way more complex than necessary and I had accidently resolved this in day 3.

## Day 7
#### Calculator

Notes: 
* Fairly easy too, make a calculator and separate each function in functions, 
the proposal was only two inputs but I knew how to make more by for's means so yeah.

Resolution:

(Haven't received it yet.)
